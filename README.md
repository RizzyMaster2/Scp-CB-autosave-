💾 SCP: Containment Breach Autosave Utility
A lightweight .exe tool that simulates F5 keypresses at regular intervals to automatically trigger in-game quicksaves for SCP: Containment Breach and similar titles. Set your own interval, toggle advanced features, and never lose progress again due to rogue peanut statues or poorly timed door glitches.

🛠️ Features
⏱️ Customizable save interval (every X seconds)

🔁 Auto-start with game detection (optional)

🎛️ Simple GUI for configuration

⌨️ Minimized keypress injection – safe and non-intrusive

🔔 System tray integration for background use

🧪 Designed with SCP:CB but supports any game that binds saving to F5

🚀 How to Use
Run SCP_AutoSave.exe

Set your desired save interval (e.g., every 60 seconds)

Enable optional features like:

“Start on launch”

“Pause when tabbed out”

“Play sound on save”

Click Start

Leave it running in the background while you play

Your game will autosave at the interval you set—no interaction required.

🧠 Notes & Tips
The tool simulates pressing F5 globally. Avoid binding F5 to anything explosive in other programs.

Works best in Save Anywhere mode or mods that support manual saving.

For vanilla SCP:CB, make sure pressing F5 in-game creates a valid save.

❗ Safety Disclaimer
This tool does not alter game memory or access protected processes. It simply sends simulated keypresses using safe, OS-level APIs. Use responsibly, and make backups of your save files if using with modded builds.
